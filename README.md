# XarigamiND xarPages Module

Xarpages is basically a module for managing pages on a site. It's main 
aim is to provide a rigid framework within which a site designer can 
structure the site from a visitor's point of view. There is an emphasis
on a hierarchical page structure, which feeds into the menus and short URLs.

Xarpages does not manage content. It does not hold or store any content directly, 
rather it relies on other modules to provide that content. Content may be 
provided using as simple a method as creating a Dynamic Data text field for 
entering HTML. It may be as complex as hooking in categories, looking up stories,
rendering them in a special template, pulling in blocks related to that page and 
adding in additional dynamic content through extensions to the short URL.
