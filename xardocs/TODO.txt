Various stuff to do:

- Import/export (itemtypes and items, with hook data, esp. DD) - partially done
- Allow specifying pid in createpage (for DD migrate)
- Allow changing itemtype in updatepage (for DD migrate
- Sample page types and pages (use the import function for this)
- A screen to give sample mod_rewrite rules to support the config (i.e. to
  remove the index.php/[xarpages] part of the path; if provided  by an API
  then a trigger or hook could be developed to automatically update
  mod_rewrite rules each time the pages are changed
- A site map example page
- Have a really good think about how to implement searches. This won't be
  easy as each page type could get its data from a different place, and this
  module has no inside knowledge of how to access that data - am tempted not
  to do this, but to use an external search engine on the rendered pages.
  For page types relying on name, desc and DD fields, this could be done
  though...
- Some good docs with examples and diagrams
- Fix admin page view so that the image on the first item displays correctly.
  It is currently displayed in the admin view screen as an empty root node
  regardless of whether it has children
- Completely templatize the selection of images in the admin tree view
- Provide selection methods (by tree etc) on the admin/view page to help
  view large numbers of pages
- Provide selection box when there is more than one template page for a
  given page type (possibly including -none- as an option) - when creating
  a new page
- Nicer error when an attempt is made to create a duplicate page type;
  currently the user gets a complex database error
- Support generating a page URL by specifying its name or path. This would
  make adding links to pages in a document easier, e.g. by matching
  #pagelink:/about/company# using Autolinks, without having to know the ID
  or even the full path of the page.
- Add copyright notices to all scripts and templates.
- Apply privileges to individual pages in the menu block.
- Provide an SSL yes/no/default option to each page
- Allow the admin to decide which DD fields are fetched by default for menus.
  For example, a menu may require the 'menu_title' field, but fetching the 
  content of every page at the same time is probably overkill. This would go
  hand-in-hand with some versatile cache so that pages, DD fields etc could
  be cached a layer or item at a time, as they are fetched within the
  generation of a single page.

- Creation of sample blocks - a crumb-trail, a CSS menu etc. - DONE
- Privileges (registered, but not yet actually used) - DONE
- Overview of module in the 'admin/main' template - DONE
- Write a module delete/remove function - DONE
- Allow page status to be changed recursively - DONE
- Sample functions (perhaps handling a publication type and categories) - DONE
- Add new status 'EMPTY' to signify an active, but empty page. An empty page
  will switch (internally - not via a redirect) to its first displayable
  child page. It will allow a visitor to be taken to the first page in a
  section without the need to provide content for the section master page.
  e.g. page 'training' may have children pages 'overview', 'managerial' and
  'technical'. If the 'training' page is empty, then navigating to it will
  actually display the 'overview' page. It allows the overview to be a
  sibling of the main pages in a section rather than the parent of pages
  in that section, which works better on some kinds of site - DONE
- Cache the page details so that they can be used by blocks - DONE
- Implement customisable page template as well as item template field to
  the page - DONE


To get this thing working in the meantime, create a page type called 'html'
and set up a DD column for it called 'body' - a large textarea field would
be good. Create pages and away you go :-)
